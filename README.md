## To update the website

You need to install either `node package manager` or `yarn` to make changes.

Firstly, make a copy of this repository from Git or download as a zip folder and unzip it

In the folder where you have your local copy of these files, open command line and enter:

### npm i --save

Then, open the file `App.js` in a text editor.

In the section of the file titled `Changeable Variables`, make edits as necessary.

To view your edits in progress, open command line and enter

### npm start

This will be what your website looks like.

If you are happy with the changes, enter

### npm run build

This will create a folder called `build`. To publish the new website, upload all contents of `build` folder onto your server.

Voila!
