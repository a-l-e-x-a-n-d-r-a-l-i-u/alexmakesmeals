# How to use this repo #

* This repo has a very thin layer of backend, but it's mosty frontend (in the folder named `client`).

* The easiest way to catch up to speed on component structure would be through `client / src / App.js` as the website navigation is defined in the section `<BrowserRouter />`.

* Feel free to use the branches `dev` and `master` for development. When the changes are ready to be published, push it to the `production` branch and the alexmakesmeals.com website will automatically update with your changes. The changes pushed to production should be immediately visible but please do give up to 10-15 minutes to see changes being reflected in the website.
